    * Added version number to the script (eventually).
    * Tagged the first version 0.1.0
    * The script was not working correctly with IM versions >= 6.9
      because the returned values of the Statistics functions changed.
      Fixed that and the script should be now working with all versions.
    * Added this ChangeLog.txt file.
    * Thanks to David Rosky for pointing out the source of the bug :)

During 2015:
    * Added support to save the luminance in XMP files and re-read it
      much faster if needed instead of having to re-calculate luminance
      from scratch.
    * Code cleanup.
    * Added some further sanity checks.
    * Thank you David Richfield (slashme) for contributing these changes
      back to this project.

Sometime in 2012...
    * Initial version was released in ubuntuforums.
